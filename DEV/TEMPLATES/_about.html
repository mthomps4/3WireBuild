				<h3> The Basics </h3>

				<p>
					I graduated with a B.A. in Art from Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky, emphasizing in Sculpture and Graphic Design with a minor in Physics. While at Georgetown, I met my wife Emily and soon followed her to Louisville, Kentucky. Currently, I manage the network and church communications for Broadway Baptist Church in Louisville, while gaining more experience in Web Development. I enjoy spending time with family and working on home projects. My hobbies include traditional woodworking and furniture design.

				<h3> The Lifestyle</h3>

					Building is my lifestyle. I wake up in the morning geared to create, fix, learn, and solve. It’s an itch. Accepting there are no exceptions to the type of work needed, it is the process that keeps me motivated. I am a Designer, Web Developer, Traditional Woodworker, a "Do It Yourselfer", and Adventuring Thinker. It's in my nature to break objects down part by part to understand function. I enjoy the history that lies beneath and restoring it back to new, sometimes in a better way. I’m always learning and always innovating, it’s a never ending process. 				</p>
