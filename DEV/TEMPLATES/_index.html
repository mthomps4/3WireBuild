As a Designer my goal Is to simplify, plan, and shape ideas into a reality. Each medium may be different, but the process remains the same. Understanding the work that lies ahead I place pen to paper, and start examining part by part. I experiment and try to find problems before they start, learning as I go. The time and energy put into this makes each project and process unique.       </div>

Technology is a thriving, growing entity based around human interaction. Limited only by our imagination it becomes a never ending path of experimentation and adaption. Following my own curiosities I started my journey in Engineering and landed in Web Development. Today, I focus on website and mobile applications utilizing JavaScript, Node.js, and Web Sockets. I continue to learn and experiment adding new tools along the way.  </p>

At the end of the day it’s nice to “unplug”. When I’m not behind a computer, you will normally find me around a workbench. With a passion for traditional woodworking I continue to learn and hone my craft by focusing on hand tools and furniture making. My goal is to keep trade skills from becoming just another chapter in a history book. You can follow the process @3WireBuild.  <a href="/#/blog">@3WireBuild</a>.</p>
