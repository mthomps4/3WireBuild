				<p>
	    		I Graduated with a B.A. in Art from Georgetown College emphasizing in Sculpture and Graphic Design with a minor in Physics. While at Georgetown I met my wife Emily and soon followed her to Louisville, KY. Currently I manage the network and church communications for Broadway Baptist Church while gaining more experience in Web Development. I enjoying spending time with family, creating "home projects" and hobbies including traditional woodworking and furniture design.

				<h3> The Lifestyle</h3>

				<p>
					Building is a lifestyle.
					I wake up in the morning geared to create, to fix, to learn, and to solve. Itâ€™s an itch. A marathon full of thoughts, each needing their own type of acknowledgement.	Accepting there are no exceptions to the type of work needed, its the process that keeps me motviated.	I am a Designer, Web Developer, Traditional Woodworker, a "Do It Yourselfer", and Adventuring Thinker. It's in my nature to break objects down... part by part... down to their core. Deconstructing in a way to better understand the purpose and history lying beneath. Always learning, always innovating, its a never ending process. Building is a lifestyle.
