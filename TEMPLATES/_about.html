				<p>
					I graduated with a B.A. in Art from Georgetown College emphasizing in Sculpture and Graphic Design with a minor in Physics. While at Georgetown I met my wife Emily and soon followed her to Louisville, KY. Currently I manage the network and church communications for Broadway Baptist Church while gaining more experience in Web Development. I enjoying spending time with family, creating "home projects" and hobbies including traditional woodworking and furniture design.

				<h3> The Lifestyle</h3>

					Building is my lifestyle. I wake up in the morning geared to create, fix, learn, and to solve. It’s an itch, and a marathon full of thoughts. Accepting there are no exceptions to the type of work needed, it is the process that keeps me motivated. I am a Designer, Web Developer, Traditional Woodworker, a <i>"Do It Yourselfer"</i>, and Adventuring Thinker (#PrayersForEmily). It's in my nature to break objects down part by part to understand function. Learning the history lying beneath and restoring it back to new sometimes in a better way. Always learning, always innovating, it’ a never ending process.
