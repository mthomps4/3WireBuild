      <p>As a Designer my goal is to simplify and plan ahead, and to shape ideas into a reality by understanding the work ahead. Each medium may be different but the process remains the same. Placing pen to paper and examining part by part, experimenting, and finding problems before they start. It’s this process, the time and energy put in that can make or break a project.</p>

      <p> Technology is a thriving, growing entity, and a never ending topic of discussion. A never ending path of learning, I started my journey in UI/UX design and CSS animations. Today, I focus on website and mobile applications, utilizing Javascript, Node.js, WebSockets. I continue to learn by experimenting and pushing limits.  </p>

      <p>At the end of the day it’s nice to <i>“unplug”</i>. When not behind a computer you will normally find me around a workbench. With a passion for traditional woodworking I continue to learn and hone my craft focusing on hand tools and furniture making. You can follow this process  <a href="/#/blog">@3WireBuild</a>.</p>
