As a Designer my goal is to simplify, plan ahead, and shape ideas into a reality by understanding the work that lies ahead. Each medium may be different but the process remains the same--placing pen to paper, examining part by part, experimenting, and finding problems before they start. The time and energy put into this process can make or break a project.      </p>

Technology is a thriving, growing entity, and a never ending topic of discussion. It’s a never ending path of learning. I started my journey in UI/UX design and CSS animations. Today, I focus on website and mobile applications--utilizing Javascript, Node.js, and WebSockets. I continue to learn by experimenting and pushing limits.       </p>

At the end of the day it’s nice to “unplug”. When I’m not behind a computer, you will normally find me around a workbench. With a passion for traditional woodworking I continue to learn and hone my craft by focusing on hand tools and furniture making.
