<p>
	I graduated with a B.A. in Art from Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky, emphasizing in Sculpture and Graphic Design with a minor in Physics. While at Georgetown, I met my wife Emily and soon followed her to Louisville, Kentucky. Currently, I manage the network and church communications for Broadway Baptist Church in Louisville, while gaining more experience in Web Development. I enjoy spending time with family, volunteering at church, and working on home projects. My hobbies include traditional woodworking and furniture design.

	To describe myself in one word, I am a <i>builder</i>. I wake up in the morning geared to create, fix, learn, and solve. It’s an itch. It is the process that keeps me motivated. I am a Designer, Web Developer, Traditional Woodworker, a "Do It Yourselfer", and Adventuring Thinker. It's in my nature to break objects down part by part to understand function. I enjoy the history that lies beneath and restoring objects back to new. I’m always learning and always innovating, always thinking, it’s a never ending process.
