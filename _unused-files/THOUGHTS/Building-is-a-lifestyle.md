- About Me

Building is a lifestyle. You wake up in the morning geared to create; to fix; and to solve. It’s an itch, a marathon full of thoughts; each needing their own type of acknowledgement. Knowing there are no exceptions as to the type of work, except that work you must. For me I am a Designer, Web Developer, woodworker, and adventuring thinker. I enjoy the nature of breaking objects down to their simplest form, only to rebuild in a way that unlocks the true potential hiding beneath. Each object shows the intent of its creator. The tools they had, the experience gathered, and the pride they had it making it something of their own. It’s a never ending process, building is a lifestyle.

Building is a lifestyle.
I wake up in the morning geared to create; to fix; to learn, and to solve.
It’s an itch. A marathon full of thoughts, each needing their own type of acknowledgement.
It's waking up knowing there are no exceptions to the type of work needed, except that work you must.
I am a Designer, Web Developer, Traditional Woodworker, "Do It Yourselfer", and Adventuring Thinker.
It's in my nature to break objects down to their simplest form.
Part by part... down to it's very core. <i>"How were you made?"</i>

It's this understanding and ability to deconstruct something slowly
in a way that unlocks the full story hiding beneath.
Each object shows the intent of its creator.
The tools they had, the experience gathered, and the pride took in it's creation.
Always learning from the past and how these objects were formed is a never ending process.
Building is a lifestyle and one that I'm proud to have embraced.
